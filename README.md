# Task-02: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

## 📌 Internship
Generative AI Internship @ Prodigy Infotech

## 🧠 Task Objective
Use pre-trained generative models to create images from natural language prompts.

## 🛠️ Model Used
Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face Spaces)

## 💡 Prompt
"A celestial goddess floating above a futuristic city, her flowing hair made of stardust, glowing eyes, holding a galaxy in her hands, surrounded by cosmic energy, ultra-detailed, sci-fi fantasy art"

## 📸 Output Images

| Image 1 | Image 2 |
|--------|--------|
| ![Image 1](./celestial_goddess_1.png) | ![Image 2](./celestial_goddess_2.png) |

| Image 3 | Image 4 |

## 📝 Summary
In this task, I explored text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.  
I used a creative prompt to visualize a fantasy sci-fi character using Stable Diffusion, and gained insight into prompt engineering and the generative capabilities of neural networks.
